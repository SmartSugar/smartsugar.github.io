		                                    <p>It is a sugar alcohol used as a sweetener. The name derives from Greek: ξύλον, xyl[on], "wood" + suffix -itol, used to denote sugar alcohols. Xylitol is categorized as a polyalcohol or sugar alcohol (alditol). It has the formula CH2OH(CHOH)3CH2OH and is an achiral isomer of pentane-1,2,3,4,5-pentol. Unlike other natural or synthetic sweeteners, xylitol is actively beneficial for dental health by reducing caries (cavities) to a third in regular use and helpful to remineralization. Multiple studies utilizing electron microscopy have indicated that xylitol is effective in inducing remineralization of deeper layers of demineralized enamel. Fair evidence was found that xylitol (as chewing gum, lozenges, nasal spray, etc.) reduced the incidence of acute middle ear infection in healthy children
		                                    </p>
		                                    <p>
		                                        Xylitol is naturally found in low concentrations in the fibers of many fruits and vegetables, and can be extracted from various berries, oats, and mushrooms, as well as fibrous material such as corn husks and sugar cane bagasse. &nbsp;However, industrial production starts from xylan (a hemicellulose) extracted from hardwoods or corncobs, which is hydrolyzed into xylose and catalytically hydrogenated into xylitol. A study in laboratory rats that compared xylitol to other artificial sweeteners found that xylitol had fewer or no side effects, had fewer calories, and was less likely to cause cavities (that is, had lower cariogenicity) than sucrose (table sugar).

		                                        Xylitol is produced by hydrogenation of xylose, which converts the sugar (an aldehyde) into a primary alcohol. Another method of producing xylitol is through microbial processes, including fermentative and biocatalytic processes in bacteria, fungi, and yeast cells, that take advantage of the xylose-intermediate fermentations to produce high yield of xylitol. Common yeast cells used in effectively fermenting and producing xylitol are Candida tropicalis and Candida guilliermondii.

Xylitol has virtually no aftertaste, and is advertised as "safe for diabetics and individuals with hyperglycemia."

		                                        As a cure for diabetics, Xylitol serves as an intermediate of sugar metabolism. By its <b>unique way of metabolism</b>, it produces 6-phosphofructose and phosphoglyceraldehyde directly via metabolism of pentose phosphate pathway without the necessity of promotion by insulin (it even promotes secretion of insulin). The 6-phosphofructose and phosphoglyceraldehyde thus produced can supply energy to the cells, maintain metabolic balance in body and effectively control diabetic syndromes. After use of this product, the commonly seen diabetic symptoms will be relieved gradually, and the users will be reported of reduced glycosuria. Through persistent use of this product, the symptoms will disappear.

		                                        As a cure for<b> improving hepatic function</b>, Xylitol can slow down the producing process of fatty acid in plasma, but won’t cause higher blood sugar. After intake, the level of lactic acid, Pyruvic acid and glucose in the blood will decrease, and insulin level will go up slightly. At the same time, the hepatic starch will increase while the aminotransferase will decrease. This is good for hepatitis B persisting type and cirrhosis. Obviously, it is an effective drug for hepatitis sufferers, especially for diabetics with accompanying hepatitis syndrome.

		                                        It may be used as an infusion in surgical operation. It's clinically proved that Xylitol has better blood stability than glucose, being an ideal sugar supplement used in internal and surgical treatment, especially after surgical anesthesia and surgical operation when there is something wrong with glucose metabolism and glucose can' t be utilized. Xylitol promotes the flow of red blood cells (RBC), maintains the negative charge of RBC, and controls the content of blood glutathione, thus <b>shortening the healing process of surgical location</b>.   
		                                    </p><p>Xylitol is effective in controlling formation of glycerol, neutral fat and free fatty acid, thus may be used to control weight gain and cure obesity. &nbsp;It has good heat stability. It will not generate chemical reaction when heated together with amino acid. Therefore, it may be mixed with amino acids and applied to various agents. Xylitol is also good for gastric secretion, pancreatic &amp; biliary activity, adrenal cortex hormone, NADPH and ATP, suitable for aged and weak people. &nbsp;As Xylitol is absorbed by the intestinal wall at a pace slower than other sugars, it may be used in combination with laxative for senile constipation, and won’t cause pain and side effect.</p>

		                                    <p><b>In humans</b><br>Xylitol has no known toxicity in humans, however, some report heart palpitations after consuming it. In one study, participants consumed a monthly average of 1.5 kg of xylitol with a maximum daily intake of 430 g with no apparent ill effects. Like most sugar alcohols, xylitol has a laxative effect because sugar alcohols are not fully broken down during digestion; however, the effect varies from person to person. In one study of 13 children, four experienced diarrhea from xylitol's laxative effect when they ate more than 65 grams per day. Studies have reported that adaptation occurs after several weeks of consumption.<br>As with other sugar alcohols, with the exception of erythritol, consumption of xylitol in excess of one's "laxation threshold" (the amount of sweetener that can be consumed before abdominal discomfort occurs) can result in temporary gastrointestinal side effects, such as bloating, flatulence, and diarrhea. Adaptation (that is, an increase of the laxation threshold) occurs with regular intake. Xylitol has a lower laxation threshold than some sugar alcohols, but is more easily tolerated than mannitol and sorbitol.</p>
		                                    <p><b>In dogs</b><br>Xylitol is often fatal to dogs. According to the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center, the number of cases of xylitol toxicosis in dogs has significantly increased since the first reports in 2002. Dogs that have eaten foods containing xylitol (greater than 100 milligrams of xylitol consumed per kilogram of bodyweight) have presented with low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), which can be life-threatening. Low blood sugar can result in a loss of coordination, depression, collapse and seizures in as little as 30 minutes. Intake of doses of xylitol (greater than 500 – 1000 mg/kg bwt) has been implicated in liver failure in dogs, which can be fatal. The possible cause of hypoglycemia experienced by dogs is that xylitol in chewing gum is released more slowly and absorbed over longer period than when it is consumed as a pure form.</p><p><b>In wild birds</b><br>Thirty Cape sugarbirds died within 30 minutes of drinking a solution made with xylitol, from a feeder in a garden in Hermanus, South Africa. It is suspected that it triggered a massive insulin release, causing an irreversible drop in blood sugar.<br></p>
